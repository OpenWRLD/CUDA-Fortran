# Different Ways of Allocating Variables

## Purpose
Here, we try to allocate host/device variables/pointers and access and modify them differently, in order to experiment with different memory registers (e.g. managed, mapped, shared, constant, etc).

## Contents
Each file stands for a single experiment.
